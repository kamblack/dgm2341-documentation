<h2>Format Evaluations</h2>

<h3>Audio</h3>

<p>I chose to evaluate MP3, WMA, and AAC files for a good range of audio. The original file was Boston's "More Than A Feeling", downloaded from the Canvas files. I used Adobe Audition to export the files in these three formats, and each format has slightly different options.</p>

<p>The illustration is a comparison screenshot of Audition's Pitch Frequency viewer. On lower quality files, the colored pitches were more narrow, comparred to the more full, rounded sound of the high quality files.</p>

<h4>MP3</h4>
<p>The options I tried with MP3 were 8-bit vs 16-bit, a range from 8000Hz to 32000Hz, and a range from 16kb/s to 256kb/s.</p>

<p>The setting that made the most difference was by far the kb/s. The file sizes ranged from 564KB @ 16kb/s all the way to 8920KB @ 256kb/s. Noticably, 8-bit vs 16-bit seemed to have no affect on the file at all - the file sizes were exactly the same, all other settings being equal, and the playback sounded the same. On the higher quality side of things, there were three files all at 32000Hz, but their file sizes had a difference of over 5000KB. When it came to playback, the lower end of the spectrum, at 16kb/s, sounded muffled, as if the speaker were being covered by a pillow. On the higher end, it was much harder to tell the difference between the MP3 and the original file, but the MP3 might have sounded a little tinny.</p>

<h4>WMA</h4>
<p>The WMA exports ranged from a very low 8kb/s up to 256kb/s. In the low quality 8kb/s file I couldn't even tell what instruments were playing. The drums sounded like a scratching needle. On the high quality end, I wasn't able to tell the difference between it and the original file.</p>

<h4>AAC</h4>
<p>My export options for AAC varied between 96kb/s and 1.15Mb/s, as well as 2 channels through 5.1 surround channels.</p>
<p>The exported AAC files were skipping and they had a hard time playing at all. I'm not certain why, but the playback in Audition was working, and my media player, VLC, plays other AAC files just fine.</p>
